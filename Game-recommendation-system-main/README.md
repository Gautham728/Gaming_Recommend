## üíº Case study 

### Requirement
Collect data about games from websites, then based on information about the gameplay or plot of the game, perform text analysis using machine learning methods related to natural language , to identify games with similar gameplay or storylines. Finally, build a recommendation application. When the user chooses a game, the system will automatically suggest 5 other games with the most similar gameplay or plot.
### application
- Products recommendation in the e-commerce or retail sector.
- Films recommendation in the online cinema industry.
- Information recommendation in the searching system like Google, Facebook...
- etc..

## üïπÔ∏è Crawl game data from website
I have crawled data from the table object [List of Nintendo Switch games (Q‚ÄìZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_games_(Q%E2%80%93Z)) from the Wikipedia website using python with 2 libraries Request and BeautifulSoup.
### Data crawled (787 games with 9 features)
20 samples

- **Title :** Name of game.
- **Link :** Link to detail information about the game.
- **Gener :** Type of game.
- **Developer :** Game Developer.
- **Publisher :** Game Publisher.

## üïπÔ∏è Game plots similarity analysis
I have performed text analysis in "Plots" features using machine learning methods in the field of natural language processing such as data cleaning (Tokenlization, Stopword elemination, Word stemming), semantic vectorization (TF-IDF), and building similarity coefficient matrices among game plots.
### Similarity coefficient matrices among game plots
Samples of 10 games

- A matrix with Name of game are also the Column title and Row index
- The numbers represent the similarity of each pair of games (Limited from 0 to 1), The smaller the number, the more similar the two games are

## üïπÔ∏è Build an game recommendation system app
I used python and the streamlit library to create a game recommendation application, to illustrate the similarity analysis between games in the section above. When the user chooses a game, the system will suggest 5 other games with similar gameplay or plots.
